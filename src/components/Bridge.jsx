            derivative ShibaCumGMElonKishuTurboAssFlokiMoon Inu coins. The Inu’s
            have had their day. It’s time for the most recognizable meme in the
            world to take his reign as king of the memes.

            Pepe is here to make memecoins great again. Launched stealth with no
